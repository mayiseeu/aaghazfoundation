      "Discover the most popular wedding aesthetics taking over this year, from quiet luxury to maximalist blooms.",
    content: `
      <p>As we step into 2024, wedding aesthetics are shifting towards a blend of timeless elegance and bold personal statements. Here are the top trends we're seeing:</p>
      <h3>1. Quiet Luxury</h3>
      <p>Think understated opulence. Monochromatic color palettes, high-quality fabrics, and minimalist floral arrangements that speak volumes through texture rather than volume.</p>
      <h3>2. Maximalist Blooms</h3>
      <p>On the other end of the spectrum, many couples are opting for "more is more" with lush, overflowing floral installations that transform venues into secret gardens.</p>
      <h3>3. Sustainable Celebrations</h3>
      <p>Eco-conscious choices are no longer a niche but a standard. From locally sourced menus to digital invitations, sustainability is stylish.</p>
      <p>Whether you prefer the understated or the bold, the key for 2024 is authenticity—making choices that truly reflect your journey as a couple.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Flowers are the heart of wedding decor. They set the tone, create fragrance, and add life to any space. But with so many options, how do you choose?</p>
      <h3>Consider Your Venue</h3>
      <p>A rustic barn calls for wildflowers and loose greenery, while a grand ballroom demands structured centerpieces and tall arrangements.</p>
      <h3>Seasonal Selection</h3>
      <p>Peonies in spring, Dahlias in late summer. Choosing in-season blooms ensures freshness and helps stay within budget.</p>
      <p>Don't be afraid to mix textures—pairing soft roses with architectural tropicals creates a modern visual interest.</p>
